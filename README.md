# Airbnb NYC Data Analysis

## Description
This R project conducts a comprehensive analysis of the Airbnb New York City database. The main objective is to understand the distribution of rental properties across different neighborhoods and to identify pricing patterns based on various factors such as location, property type, and availability.

### Key Analytical Steps:
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the Airbnb dataset and performing preprocessing steps to ensure data quality. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data formats, and filtering data for relevant analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting an initial exploration to understand the structure and key characteristics of the dataset. This includes summary statistics and distribution analysis of prices, room types, and neighborhood data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to analyze the relationships between price and other variables such as room type, number of reviews, and overall availability.
- **Visualization**: Creating visualizations using `ggplot2` to show:
  - Price distribution across different neighborhoods.
  - Comparison of property types and their popularity.
  - Heatmaps of property availability.

### Results:
- The analysis reveals insights into the pricing strategies of hosts across different neighborhoods, the popularity of various property types, and the impact of reviews on rental prices. Key findings include [highlight any specific insights or patterns observed].

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **R**
- **R Libraries**: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, `tidyr` - these libraries help in managing and visualizing the data effectively.

## How to Run
- Ensure R and the necessary libraries are installed.
- Run the script in your R environment to replicate the analysis. Make sure to set your working directory to the location of the Airbnb dataset.
